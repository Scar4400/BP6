Key features of `data_integration.py`:

1. Integrates all steps of the pipeline: data fetching, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
2. Provides a single entry point (`run_pipeline()`) to execute the entire process.
3. Allows for easy prediction of new matches using trained models.

To significantly improve the accuracy of predicting football matches, we've made the following overall improvements:

1. Enhanced data collection by using asynchronous requests to fetch data from multiple sources concurrently.
2. Improved data preprocessing by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features.
3. Expanded feature engineering to include team stats, head-to-head features, form features, and odds-based features.
4. Implemented feature selection to focus on the most informative variables.
5. Used multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Logistic Regression) with hyperparameter tuning to capture different aspects of the data.
6. Created a comprehensive evaluation system that considers multiple metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score).
7. Added feature importance analysis to gain insights into the most predictive factors.
8. Developed an integrated pipeline that streamlines the entire process from data collection to prediction.

To further improve the system, you could consider:

1. Implementing ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models.
2. Incorporating time series analysis to capture trends and seasonality in team performance.
3. Adding more external data sources, such as weather conditions or player injuries.
4. Implementing a rolling window approach for feature engineering to capture recent performance more accurately.
5. Using more advanced techniques like neural networks or Gaussian processes for modeling.

Remember to regularly update your data and retrain your models to maintain their predictive power over time.
